# 🛡️ Honeypot Threat Monitor (SOC Analyst Project)

This project simulates a real-world SOC task by analyzing SSH honeypot attack logs. It focuses on identifying brute-force attacks, visualizing attacker behavior, and mapping threat activity using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Detect brute-force login attempts (SSH)
- Visualize attacker IPs and username patterns
- Map attack activity to MITRE ATT&CK (T1110.001)

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Key Outcomes
- Identified top attacker IPs and common login attempts
- Mapped behavior to MITRE: Tactic = Credential Access, Technique = Brute Force (T1110.001)

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Implement anomaly detection (AI)
- Add basic alerting logic

# 🛡️ Honeypot Threat Monitor (SOC Analyst Project)

This project analyzes SSH honeypot attack attempts and visualizes attacker behavior. It includes MITRE ATT&CK classification for brute-force detection and lays the groundwork for AI-based anomaly detection.

## ✅ Features
- Log parsing from a simulated honeypot
- Top attacker IP visualization
- Most common usernames attempted
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1110.001

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add AI anomaly detection
- Auto-alert system for suspicious IPs
